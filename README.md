# Anurag Kumar's Terminal Portfolio Card

This is my interactive terminal portfolio, a creative and fun way to get to know me. Built with Node.js, this CLI tool provides quick access to my professional links, allows you to download my resume, and even fetches real-time stats from my GitHub and WakaTime profiles.

It's designed to be a memorable introduction for anyone who loves the command line.

## Demo

When you run the card, you'll see a sleek, colorized profile summary:

You will then be prompted with a list of actions to choose from.

## Usage

No installation is needed. Just run this command in your terminal:

```bash

This command fetches and executes the script, displaying my portfolio card and an interactive menu.
