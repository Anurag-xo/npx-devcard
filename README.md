# Anurag Kumar's Portfolio Card

This is a simple, interactive portfolio card for the command line, built with Node.js. It's a fun way to introduce myself and provide quick access to my contact information, resume, and social profiles.

## Demo

You will then be prompted with a list of actions to choose from.

## Installation

You don't need to install anything! You can run this portfolio card directly using `npx`.

## Usage

To run the portfolio card, open your terminal and type:

```bash
npx anuragxo
```

This will fetch and run the script, displaying my portfolio card and an interactive menu of options.

## Features

The interactive menu allows you to:

- **Send an Email:** Opens your default email client to send me an email.
- **Download my Resume:** Downloads a copy of my resume to your current directory.
- **Schedule a Meeting:** Opens my Calendly link to schedule a meeting.
- **Show my GitHub Stats:** Fetches and displays my latest GitHub stats.
- **Surprise Me!:** Shows a random tech-related fact or tip.
- **Exit:** Exits the portfolio card.
